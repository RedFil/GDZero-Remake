## The first GDZero project
GDZero was a project created by my friends and I as a final project to our university course.

## Why a Remake?
This project (GDZero-Remake) is my attempt to re-do the project with all my knowledge today and to see how far I can go on my own and compare the results.

## GDZero Description
GDZero is a Multiplayer Platform Fighting game with a Medieval and Fantasy Theme.

###### Gameplay
The gameplay is composed by 2 parts:
1. A brawl for an object:
  - This part is a one-hit deathmatch.
  - However, the main objective is to hold a given object (for example, a crown) as long as possible.
  - The player who holded the object for the longest amount of time (summed) wins this part.
2. The tiebreaker:
  - This part is a one-hit deathmatch as well.
  - In this moment, the object shows kind of wings and floats wildly around the scene.
  - The player who manage to capture the flying object earns a big amount of points.

###### Win Condition
- The one with more points in the end of the second part Wins.
